## Project Overview
This project presents a web-based Learning Management System (LMS) designed to support online teaching and learning activities in an academic environment. The system enables instructors to upload course materials, create assignments, grade submissions, and provide feedback, while students can access learning resources, submit assignments, and view grades and performance reports.

The LMS relies on a centralized database to manage users, courses, assignments, submissions, and grades. Notification mechanisms are used to inform users about important academic events such as deadlines, updates, and feedback availability.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Diagram Design:** draw.io
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Documentation:** Markdown, Pandoc
- **Version Control:** GitHub

## Team Contributions

### Responsibilities and Major Contributions
In this project, a cross-functional approach was adopted where **everyone worked on everything**. Every team member participated in the analysis, design, and documentation phases to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the system.

* **Requirements Analysis:** All members contributed to defining the problem statement, stakeholders, and functional requirements.
* **UML Modeling:** The team collaborated on the design of all diagrams (Context, Activity, Use Case, Sequence, Class, and State) through peer-review sessions to ensure architectural consistency.
* **Technical Documentation:** Each member authored specific sections of the `report.md` and contributed to the behavioral modeling descriptions and stimulus tables.
* **Quality Assurance:** Diagrams and descriptions were cross-checked by all members to align with the project’s technical requirements.

### Collaboration Workflow
Our team utilized a standard software engineering workflow to manage the project lifecycle:
* **Version Control:** Hosted on GitHub, ensuring all changes were tracked via descriptive commit messages.
* **Commits & Tracking:** Individual progress was captured through frequent commits, allowing the team to monitor the evolution of the UML models and documentation.
* **Issue Resolution:** Problems identified during the diagramming phase were discussed and resolved collectively before being merged into the final documentation.
* **Documentation Pipeline:** We used Pandoc for continuous integration of our Markdown files into the final PDF report, ensuring consistent formatting across all versions.
